# Reflective practice
- This section gives another chance to practice live coding,
  and giving feedback
- Opportunity to make changes based on the feedback

# Exercise: Round Two
- Have a look at this [rubric] which trainers use as a framework for evaluating
  instructor checkout teaching demos
- Does the rubric make sense?
- Think about things you'd like to do differently in your next live coding practice
- What questions do you have about teaching demonstration?
- Return to the same groups, and re-teach same same lesson segment,
  incorporating changes based on your feedback and any new ideas from the rubric
- Give feedback using the checkout rubric
- Add some thoughts on this process to the shared document
  - What did you change?
  - What might you change next time?
