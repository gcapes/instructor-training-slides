# Managing a diverse classroom
- Workshops targetted at novices, but they have various backgrounds and skills
- Can be novice in one topic, and more advanced in others

## Exercise
- What are the challenges in adjusting your instruction accordingly?

# Some strategies
- Communicate level of workshop clearly - with details
- Have 'beginner' and 'advanced' exercises
- Ask more advanced learners to help the more novice
- Don't let ethusiastic advanced questions carry the conversation
  - Alienates novices
- Keep an eye out for anyone falling behind to pick it up early

No class is homogeneous, so can't meet everyone's needs!

# Code of conduct violations
- We use a code of conduct to create a respectful, inclusive learning environment
- Occasionally, managing a classroom includes handling a violation
  - Warning/ apology/ leave workshop depending
  - Report to the Carpentries

# Never teach alone
- Carpentries tend to use 'teach and assist' rather than 'team teaching'
- Both provide opportunities for lateral knowledge transfer
- Gives your voice a rest
- In-class support from 'helpers'
  - Set-up, spot people who need help, monitor shared notes

# Exercise: teaching together
- You're going to teach a workshop
  - How do you prepare
  - What should(n't) the assisting intructor do to help during the workshop?

# Key points
- Working with a broad range of learners can be challenging,
  but there are many ways to keep a classroom happy and motivated.
- Response to a Code-of-Conduct violation at a workshop is subject to instructor discretion,
  but all violations should be reported to the Carpentries for follow-up.
