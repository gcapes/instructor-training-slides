# Managing a diverse classroom


# Key points
- Working with a broad range of learners can be challenging,
  but there are many ways to keep a classroom happy and motivated.
- Response to a Code-of-Conduct violation at a workshop is subject to instructor discretion,
  but all violations should be reported to the Carpentries for follow-up.
