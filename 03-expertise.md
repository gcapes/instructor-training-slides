# What makes an expert?
- Novice to competent practitioner via building mental model.
- Novices don't have a good mental model
- Competent practitioners have a good-enough mental model

# Exercise
- Name someone that you think is an expert (doesn’t matter what they’re an expert in).
  As an expert, what makes them special or different from other people?

OR

- What is something that you’re an expert in?
  How does your experience when you’re acting as an expert differ from when you’re not an expert?

This discussion should take about 5 minutes.

# What makes an expert
Experts have more connections between pieces of knowledge --
it's not just that they know more facts.
Experts can

- see connections that others can't
- see a single problem in different ways (fluid representations)
- jump from problem to solution without 'showing their working'
  - Competent practitioner would reason A, therefore B, etc.

::: notes

The more connections a fact has to other facts,
the more likely it is to be remembered.

Helping learners to make connections is as important as introducing them to facts.

# Expertise and teaching
- Things which seem obvious to you will likely not be to your learners.
- It's important to explain what you're doing step by step
- e.g. relative vs absolute paths in Bash
