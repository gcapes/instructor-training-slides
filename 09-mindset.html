<h1>Importance of mindset</h1>
<ul>
<li>Fixed mindset: ability is intrinsic
<ul>
<li>“I’m no good at sports, maths, etc”</li>
<li>Give up when faced with difficulty</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Growth mindset: almost anything can be learned
<ul>
<li>Seek out challenges</li>
<li>Work harder to overcome failure</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Fixed mindset people avoid situations where they have to perform</li>
<li>Reduces opportunities for practice and feedback (essential for learning)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="exercise-does-mindset-matter" class="slide level1">
<h1>Exercise: Does mindset matter?</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Think</em>: What kind of mindset do you have about different areas? Is there anything you believe you are “not naturally talented” at? Mindset often varies in different areas – someone might have a fixed mindset with respect to artistic ability, but a growth mindset with respect to computing skill. Then, think about your learners. How might a learner’s mindset about computational skill influence their learning in a workshop setting?</li>
<li><em>Pair</em>: Discuss your thoughts about the influence of mindset in a workshop. Try to come up with a few different ways or situations in which mindset might be relevant.</li>
<li><em>Share</em>: A few thoughts in the shared document</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>If you recognize aspects of the fixed mindset in yourself, don’t panic!</li>
<li>Like everything else, a growth mindset can be learned.</li>
<li>We’re going to talk about some strategies that will help you promote a growth mindset in your learners and yourself.</li>
</ul>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="praise-influences-mindset" class="slide level1">
<h1>Praise influences mindset</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Performance based</em>: “Great job”
<ul>
<li>Often combined with language which supports fixed mindset</li>
<li>“You must be very smart”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Effort based</em>: “You must have worked very hard”
<ul>
<li>Helps transition to growth mindset</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Improvement based</em>: “You’re doing so much better than last time”
<ul>
<li>Reinforces growth mindset</li>
<li>Ability to improve with effort</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="exercise-choosing-our-praises" class="slide level1">
<h1>Exercise: Choosing our praises</h1>
<p>Since we’re so used to being praised for our performance, it can be challenging to change the way we praise our learners.</p>
<p>Which of these are examples of performance-based, effort-based, or improvement-based praise?</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the way you tried a couple of different strategies to solve that problem.</li>
<li>You’re getting really good at that. Keep up the hard work!</li>
<li>You’re really good at that.</li>
<li>That was a hard problem. You didn’t get the right answer, but look at how much you learned trying to solve it!</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="errors-are-essential-to-learning" class="slide level1">
<h1>Errors are essential to learning</h1>
<ul>
<li>Avoidance of making errors is a barrier to learning</li>
<li>Positive <em>error framing</em> presents errors as integral part of learning
<ul>
<li>Use them as teaching opportunities (live coding - how to debug)</li>
<li>Errors provide learning opportunities, not negative consequences</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="exercise-helping-learners-learn-from-mistakes" class="slide level1">
<h1>Exercise: Helping learners learn from mistakes</h1>
<ul>
<li>A learner at your workshop asks for your help with an exercise and shows you their attempt at solving it.</li>
<li>You see they’ve made an error that shows they misunderstand something fundamental about the lesson (for example, in the shell lesson, they forgot to put a space between <code>ls</code> and the name of the directory they are looking at).</li>
<li>What would you say to the learner?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="perseverance-predicts-success" class="slide level1">
<h1>Perseverance predicts success</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Grit</em> is an essential trait in learning
<ul>
<li>Willing to fail if it gets them closer to goal</li>
<li>Learners with grit are more successful in life</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Grit can be learned. Help learners obtain grit by
<ul>
<li>sharing your experiences of struggle</li>
<li>promoting perseverance (praise improvement)</li>
<li>sharing passion</li>
<li>emphasise long-term goals</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="exercise-how-are-you-gritty" class="slide level1">
<h1>Exercise: How Are You Gritty?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Think of a time when learning something was difficult for you, or you made a mistake that seemed silly or embarrassing.</li>
<li>How did you motivate yourself to continue learning?</li>
<li>How did it feel to persist in the face of challenge?</li>
<li>How do you feel now about your capabilities in this area?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the shared document, describe how you could use this story to illustrate the importance of grit for your learners.</p>

<section id="habits-of-lifelong-learners" class="slide level1">
<h1>Habits of lifelong learners</h1>
<ul>
<li>Being a lifelong learner is good for your job propects
<ul>
<li>non-routine problem solving</li>
<li>able to focus on cognitively demanding tasks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Lifelong learning results from growth mindset</li>
<li>Emphasise help-seeking behaviour as positive</li>
<li>Show that we as instructors
<ul>
<li>are life-long learners</li>
<li>don’t know everything!</li>
