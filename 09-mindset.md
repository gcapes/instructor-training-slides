# Importance of mindset
- Fixed mindset: ability is intrinsic
  - "I'm no good at sports, maths, etc"
  - Give up when faced with difficulty
- Growth mindset: almost anything can be learned
  - Seek out challenges
  - Work harder to overcome failure

- Fixed mindset people avoid situations where they have to perform
- Reduces opportunities for practice and feedback (essential for learning)

# Does mindset matter?
- *Think*: What kind of mindset do you have about different areas? Is there anything you believe you are “not naturally talented” at? Mindset often varies in different areas – someone might have a fixed mindset with respect to artistic ability, but a growth mindset with respect to computing skill. Then, think about your learners. How might a learner’s mindset about computational skill influence their learning in a workshop setting?
- *Pair*: Discuss your thoughts about the influence of mindset in a workshop.
  Try to come up with a few different ways or situations in which mindset might be relevant.
- *Share*: A few thoughts in the Etherpad

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

::: notes

- If you recognize aspects of the fixed mindset in yourself, don’t panic!
- Like everything else, a growth mindset can be learned.
- We’re going to talk about some strategies that will help you promote a growth mindset in your learners and yourself.

# Praise influences mindset
- *Performance based*: "Great job"
  - Often combined with language which supports fixed mindset
  - "You must be very smart"
- *Effort based*: "You must have worked very hard"
  - Helps transition to growth mindset
- *Improvement based*: "You're doing so much better than last time"
  - Reinforces growth mindset
  - Ability to improve with effort

# Choosing our praises
Since we’re so used to being praised for our performance,
it can be challenging to change the way we praise our learners.

Which of these are examples of performance-based, effort-based, or improvement-based praise?

- I like the way you tried a couple of different strategies to solve that problem.
- You’re getting really good at that. Keep up the hard work!
- You’re really talented.
- That was a hard problem. You didn’t get the right answer, but look at how much you learned trying to solve it!


# Key points
- Growth mindset and grit promote learning by making effort a positive thing
- Presenting errors as essential to learning helps learners to learn from their mistakes
- Lifelong learners aren't embarrassed to ask for help
