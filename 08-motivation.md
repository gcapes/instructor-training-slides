% Motivation and demotivation
% Gerard Capes

# Overview
- Motivation is the best predictor of learning,
  and this episode covers typical ways learners are motivated,
  and how they can be demotivated.
- Situation we're often dealing with:
  - Most scientists just want to do science,
    and view programming as a 'tax'.
  - Early programming experiences often demoralising.

::: notes

There are various things we can do to help learners to care about a topic,
and believe they can master it.

:::

# Creating a positive learning environment
- Is important for learner success
- Crucial to establish workshop as safe space for learning
  - Present instructor as learner: OK to make mistakes (live coding)
  - Establish norms for interaction: code of conduct, taking turns in discussions
  - Acknowledge material is challenging, and their misunderstandings are valid

# Teach most useful first
- People learn best when they care about a topic *and* believe they can master it.
- Aim to teach something *they* think is useful in first 15 mins.
  - Something they can apply to their work
  - Also builds confidence in us for later episodes, if the useful bit takes longer to get to
  - 'Authentic tasks' will be highly motivating

# Exercise: think, pair, share
- **Think** about some task you did this week that uses one or more of the skills we teach,
  (e.g. wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, built a plot in R, forked a repo) and
  explain how you would use it (or a simplified version of it) as an exercise or example in class.
- **Pair** up with your neighbor and decide where this exercise fits on a graph of “short/long time to master”
  and “low/high usefulness”.
- In the class shared document, **share** the task and where it fits on the graph.
  As a group, we will discuss how these relate back to our “teach most immediately useful first” approach.

This exercise and discussion should take about 10 minutes.

# Motivation strategies
- Connect the material to students’ interests
- Provide authentic, real-world tasks
- Show relevance to students’ current academic lives
- Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students’ future professional lives
- Identify and reward what you value
- Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline

::: notes

In addition to teaching things that will make our learners’ lives easier and focusing on authentic tasks,
there are a number of other strategies we can use to motivate learners.

Useful to check lessons against these points to make sure they’re doing at least a few of these things.

1. e.g. pre-workshop questionnaire, anything that interests them?
2. Authentic real-world task: Rayna - what she does for bioinformaticians
 - Unix lesson, use a haiku to teach grep.
 - This is a great tool, but it can be hard for learners to see how they can use it in their research,
    e.g. bioinformatics
 - Afterwards, she shows a one liner that combines head, grep, sort, and uniq command line tools
   to produce a ranked list of the most abundant sequences
 - She emphasizes that the students just learned each of the pieces
 - This way, she connects her bioinformatics users with domain-specific examples
   using an authentic task that is relevant to their research
3. e.g. version control in SWC
   - greater expectation from EPSRC research council to make academic software available
4. e.g. testing - reproducibility of results in medical studies shockingly low in some areas,
   automated testing can help improve productivity
6. Comparative studies of different teaching techniques – most important factor was teacher’s enthusiasm

# Exercise
## Strategies for motivating learners
- Discuss ideas from the list in the shared document,
  and describe how they can be applied in our workshops

# Exercise
## Brainstorm motivational strategies
- Think back to a computational (or other) course you took in the past,
  and identify one thing the instructor did that motivated you.
- Pair up with your neighbour and discuss what motivated you.
- Share the motivational story in the shared document.

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

# Demotivation
- Motivation can go both ways - don't crush their enthusiasm!
- No-one intends to demotivate, but it's easy to do accidentally.

# Exercise
## Brainstorming demotivational experiences
- Think back to a time when you were demotivated as a student (or when you demotivated a student).
- Pair up with your neighbour and discuss what could have been done differently in the situation
  to make it not demotivating.
- Share your story in the shared document.

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

::: notes

- Highlight a few of the things that could have been done differently.
- This will give everyone some confidence in how to handle these situations.

:::

# Demotivators
- *Unfairness* and *indifference*
- Other things not to do:
  - Be scornful of any tool e.g. Excel, Word, GUI applications
    - By association, learners will feel like you're criticizing *them*
  - Dive into complex discussion with 1 or 2 people
  - Pretend to know more than you do
  - Use the J word (just)
  - Feign surprise


::: notes

- All problems are valid problems
- Treat them all equally
- It can be difficult to avoid these entirely
  - Might be very used to mocking Windows/Mac/Linux users with friends
    and fail to realise you're doing it
- Worth the effort to avoid these demotivators
  - No-one likes being made fun of!

:::

# Stereotype threat
> Self-confirming belief that one may be evaluated based on a negative stereotype

- Anxiety about confirming those stereotypes can reduce performance
  - Don't remind people of negative stereotypes
  - “I’m so glad you’re here because we don’t get enough women in programming.”
- Never learn alone
  - Get people to sign up in groups

# Imposter syndrome
![The unfounded belief that you're not good enough](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/impostor_syndrome.png)

# Dealing with imposter syndrome
- Ask for feedback from someone you trust, and believe it!
- Learn from role models

- Academics are particularly susceptible  (isolated working, public results)
- Share stories of your mistakes and struggles
  - It's OK to find things difficult!
- Emphasise that you want questions

# Accessibility
- Unequal access to lessons is demotivating!
  - e.g. screen readers unable to read images
- Not always possible to accommodate everyone, but *can* have a structure in place
  - Do easy things first, gives confidence other concerns will be addressed
  - e.g. font, text size, room access
- **Accessibility measures help everyone**
  - e.g. curb cuts, image captioning

# Exercise
The UK Home Office has put together a set of posters of dos and don’ts
for making visual and web-based materials more accessible for different populations.
Take a look at one of [these posters](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/posters/blob/master/accessibility/dos-donts/posters_en-UK/accessibility-posters-set.pdf) and put one thing you’ve learned in the shared document.

This exercise should take about 5 minutes.

# Inclusivity
- Policy of including people who might otherwise be marginalised
  - e.g. women, people of colour, LGBT, disabled
- Making a positive effort to be more welcoming to those groups
- Make notes free of gendered pronouns, use culturally diverse names
- Emphasise the rate of learning is important, not their starting point
- Encourage pair programming

# [Code of conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)
- Sets expectations for participation
- Just the fact it exists tells people something about our values
- "Be excellent to each other"

# Key points
- A positive learning environment helps people concentrate on learning.
- People learn best when they see the utility in what they’re learning,
  so teach what’s most immediately useful first.
- Imposter syndrome is a powerful force, but can be overcome.
- Accessibility benefits everyone.
