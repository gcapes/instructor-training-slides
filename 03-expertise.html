<section id="what-makes-an-expert" class="slide level1">
<h1>What makes an expert?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Novice to competent practitioner via building mental model.</li>
<li>Novices don’t have a good mental model</li>
<li>Competent practitioners have a good-enough mental model</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="exercise-what-is-an-expert" class="slide level1">
<h1>Exercise: What is an expert?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Name someone that you think is an expert (doesn’t matter what they’re an expert in). As an expert, what makes them special or different from other people?</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
<li>What is something that you’re an expert in? How does your experience when you’re acting as an expert differ from when you’re not an expert?</li>
</ul>
<p>This discussion should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-makes-an-expert-1" class="slide level1">
<h1>What makes an expert</h1>
<p>Experts have more connections between pieces of knowledge – it’s not just that they know more facts. Experts can</p>
<ul>
<li>see connections that others can’t</li>
<li>see a single problem in different ways (fluid representations)
<ul>
<li>e.g. character vectors vs strings</li>
<li>e.g. numerical vs logical array indexing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>jump from problem to solution without ‘showing their working’
<ul>
<li>Competent practitioner would reason A, therefore B, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section class="slide level1">

</figure>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>This representation is just a metaphor!</li>
<li>The more connections a fact has to other facts, the more likely it is to be remembered.</li>
<li>Helping learners to make connections is as important as introducing them to facts.</li>
</ul>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="expertise-and-teaching" class="slide level1">
<h1>Expertise and teaching</h1>
<ul>
<li>As an expert, conclusions which seem obvious to you will likely not be to your learners.</li>
<li>Two ways of thinking about a problem may be interchangeable to you (but not to a novice!)</li>
<li>Therefore it’s important to explain what you’re doing step-by-step
<ul>
<li>e.g. switching between relative and absolute paths in Bash</li>
<li>This is particularly important when diagnosing errors: be explicit about the process even if it seems trivial to you</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="exercise-fluid-representations" class="slide level1">
<h1>Exercise: Fluid representations</h1>
<p>In the shared document, give at least one example of a fluid representation that you use in your own work. If you can, also give an example of a fluid representation that might occur in a Carpentry lesson.</p>
<p>This discussion should take about 5 minutes.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Building awareness of how you can represent the same concept in multiple different ways will help you avoid doing so without explanation while teaching.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="expert-blind-spot" class="slide level1">
<h1>Expert blind spot</h1>
<ul>
<li>Experts are often so familiar with their subject they can’t image not seeing the world from a non-expert perspective</li>
<li>This is why some excellent researchers make poor lecturers</li>
<li>Can be overcome with training
<ul>
<li>Identify potential blindspots</li>
<li>View the problem from the learner’s perspective</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="dismissive-language" class="slide level1">
<h1>Dismissive language</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Just</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gives learners the very clear signal that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and that they therefore must be stupid.</p>
<p>With practice we can avoid this type of demotivating language and replace it with more positive word choices.</p>
</section>
<section id="exercise-changing-your-language" class="slide level1">
<h1>Exercise: Changing your language</h1>
<ul>
<li>What other words or phrases can have the effect of demotivating learners?</li>
<li><p>What alternatives can we use to express this meaning in a positive and motivational way?</p></li>
<li><p>In the shared document, make a list of demotivating words/phrases and alternatives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This discussion should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-questions-do-people-have" class="slide level1">
<h1>What questions do people have?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Asking this instead of ‘Does anyone have any questions?’ indicates that you’re expecting questions, and that this is normal.</li>
<li>‘Any questions?’ can create the impression you hope there won’t be any.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="you-are-not-your-learners" class="slide level1">
<h1>You are not your learners</h1>
<ul>
<li>Most scientists’ primary goal is not to program, but to do scientific research.</li>
<li>We therefore have to make sure that everything we teach is useful right away, and conversely that we don’t teach anything just because it’s “fundamental”.</li>
<li>Believing that something will be hard to learn is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<ul>
<li>It’s important <em>not</em> to say that something is easy.</li>
<li>If someone who has been told that tries it, and it doesn’t work, they are more likely to become discouraged.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="importance-of-practice" class="slide level1">
<h1>Importance of practice</h1>
<ul>
<li>Use formative assessments frequently to help tailor your teaching to your learners
<ul>
<li>Find out about your learners’ goals and motivations</li>
<li>Overcome your expert blindspot</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="key-points" class="slide level1">
<h1>Key points</h1>
<ul>
<li>Experts face challenges when teaching due to expert blindspot</li>
<li>Expert blindspot is knowing something so well it seems easy when it isn’t</li>
<li>Can overcome expert blindspot with practice</li>
</ul>
