<section id="overview" class="slide level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<ul>
<li>Motivation is the best predictor of learning, and this episode covers typical ways learners are motivated, and how they can be demotivated.</li>
<li>Situation we’re often dealing with:
<ul>
<li>Most scientists just want to do science, and view programming as a ‘tax’.</li>
<li>Early programming experiences often demoralising.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>There are various things we can do to help learners to care about a topic, and believe they can master it.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="creating-a-positive-learning-environment" class="slide level1">
<h1>Creating a positive learning environment</h1>
<ul>
<li>Is important for learner success</li>
<li>Crucial to establish workshop as safe space for learning
<ul>
<li>Present instructor as learner: OK to make mistakes (live coding)</li>
<li>Establish norms for interaction: code of conduct, taking turns in discussions</li>
<li>Acknowledge material is challenging, and their misunderstandings are valid</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="teach-most-useful-first" class="slide level1">
<h1>Teach most useful first</h1>
<ul>
<li>People learn best when they care about a topic <em>and</em> believe they can master it.</li>
<li>Aim to teach something <em>they</em> think is useful in first 15 mins.
<ul>
<li>Something they can apply to their work</li>
<li>Also builds confidence in us for later episodes, if the useful bit takes longer to get to</li>
<li>‘Authentic tasks’ will be highly motivating</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<section id="exercise-authentic-tasks" class="slide level1">
<h1>Exercise: Authentic tasks</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Think</strong> about some task you did this week that uses one or more of the skills we teach, (e.g. wrote a function, bulk downloaded data, built a plot in R, forked a repo) and explain how you would use it (or a simplified version of it) as an exercise or example in class.</li>
<li><strong>Pair</strong> up with your neighbor and decide where this exercise fits on a graph of “short/long time to master” and “low/high usefulness”.</li>
<li>In the class shared document, <strong>share</strong> the task and where it fits on the graph. As a group, we will discuss how these relate back to our “teach most immediately useful first” approach.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise and discussion should take about 10 minutes.</p>
</section>
<section id="motivation-strategies" class="slide level1">
<h1>Motivation strategies</h1>
<ul>
<li>Connect the material to students’ interests</li>
<li>Provide authentic, real-world tasks</li>
<li>Show relevance to students’ current academic lives</li>
<li>Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students’ future professional lives</li>
<li>Identify and reward what you value</li>
<li>Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>In addition to teaching things that will make our learners’ lives easier and focusing on authentic tasks, there are a number of other strategies we can use to motivate learners.</p>
<p>Useful to check lessons against these points to make sure they’re doing at least a few of these things.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>e.g. pre-workshop questionnaire, anything that interests them?</li>
<li>Authentic real-world task: Rayna - what she does for bioinformaticians</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Unix lesson, use a haiku to teach grep.</li>
<li>This is a great tool, but it can be hard for learners to see how they can use it in their research, e.g. bioinformatics</li>
<li>Afterwards, she shows a one liner that combines head, grep, sort, and uniq command line tools to produce a ranked list of the most abundant sequences</li>
<li>She emphasizes that the students just learned each of the pieces</li>
<li>This way, she connects her bioinformatics users with domain-specific examples using an authentic task that is relevant to their research</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>e.g. version control in SWC
<ul>
<li>greater expectation from EPSRC research council to make academic software available</li>
</ul></li>
<li>e.g. testing - reproducibility of results in medical studies shockingly low in some areas, automated testing can help improve productivity</li>
<li>Comparative studies of different teaching techniques – most important factor was teacher’s enthusiasm</li>
</ol>

<li>Pair up with your neighbour and discuss what motivated you.</li>
<li>Share the motivational story in the shared document.</li>
</ul>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>

<h1>Exercise</h1>
<h2 id="brainstorming-demotivational-experiences">Brainstorming demotivational experiences</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Highlight a few of the things that could have been done differently.</li>
<li>This will give everyone some confidence in how to handle these situations.</li>
</ul>

<section id="demotivators" class="slide level1">
<h1>Demotivators</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Unfairness</em> and <em>indifference</em></li>
<li>Other things not to do:
<ul>
<li>Be scornful of any tool e.g. Excel, Word, GUI applications
<ul>
<li>By association, learners will feel like you’re criticizing <em>them</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dive into complex discussion with 1 or 2 people</li>
<li>Pretend to know more than you do</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>All problems are valid problems</li>
<li>Treat them all equally</li>
<li>It can be difficult to avoid these entirely
<ul>
<li>Might be very used to mocking Windows/Mac/Linux users with friends and fail to realise you’re doing it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Worth the effort to avoid these demotivators
<ul>
<li>No-one likes being made fun of!</li>

<section id="accessibility" class="slide level1">
<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<ul>
<li>Unequal access to lessons is demotivating!
<ul>
<li>e.g. screen readers unable to read images</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Not always possible to accommodate everyone, but <em>can</em> have a structure in place
<ul>
<li>Do easy things first, gives confidence other concerns will be addressed</li>
